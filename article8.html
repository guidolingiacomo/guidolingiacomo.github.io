       <h1>COMPETITION RULES</h1> 
        <h2>Article 8: The recording of the moves</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the course of play each player is required to record his own moves and those of his opponent in the correct manner, move after move, as clearly and legibily as possible, in the algebraic notation (See Appendix C), on the scoresheet prescribed for the competition.<br />It is forbidden to write the moves in advance, unless the player is claiming a draw according to Article 9.2, or 9.3 or adjourning a game according to the Guidelines of Adjourned Games point 1.a.<br />A player may reply to his opponent&apos;s move before recording it, if he so wishes. He must record his previous move before making another.<br />Both players must record the offer of a draw on the scoresheet. (See Appendix C.13)<br />If a player is unable to keep score, an assistant, who must be acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to write the moves. His clock shall be adjusted by the arbiter in an equitable way.</li>
            <li>The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter throughout the game.</li>
            <li>The scoresheets are the property of the organisers of the event.</li>
            <li>If a player has less than five minutes left on his clock at some stage in a period and does not have additional time of 30 seconds or more added with each move, then for the remainder of the period he is not obliged to meet the requirements of Article 8.1. Immediately after one flag has fallen the player must update his scoresheet completely before moving a piece on the chessboard.</li>
            <li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>If neither player is required to keep score under Article 8.4, the arbiter or an assistant should try to be present and keep score. In this case, immediately after one flag has fallen, the arbiter shall stop the clocks. Then both players shall update their scoresheets, using the arbiter&apos;s or the opponent&apos;s scoresheet.</li>
                    <li>If only one player is not required to keep score under Article 8.4, he must, as soon as either flag has fallen, update his scoresheet completely before moving a piece on the chessboard. Provided it is the player&apos;s move, he may use his opponent&apos;s scoresheet, but must return it before making a move.</li>
                    <li>If no complete scoresheet is available, the players must reconstruct the game on a second chessboard under the control of the arbiter or an assistant. He shall first record the actual game position, clock times and the number of moves made, if this information is available, before reconstruction takes place.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If the scoresheets cannot be brought up to date showing that a player has overstepped the allotted time, the next move made shall be considered as the first of the following time period, unless there is evidence that more moves have been made.</li>
            <li>At the conclusion of the game both players shall sign both scoresheets, indicating the result of the game. Even if incorrect, this result shall stand, unless the arbiter decides otherwise.</li>
        </ol>

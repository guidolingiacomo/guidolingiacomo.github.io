       <h1>APPENDICES</h1> 
        <h2>Appendix B: Blitz</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A &apos;blitz&apos; game is one where all the moves must be made in a fixed time of less than 15 minutes for each player; or the allotted time + 60 times any increment is less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Where there is adequate supervision of play, (one arbiter for one game) the Competition Rules and Appendix A.2 shall apply.</li>
            <li>Where supervision is inadequate the following shall apply:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Play shall be governed by the Rapidplay Laws as in Appendix A except where they are overridden by the following Laws of Blitz.</li>
                    <li>Article 10.2 and Appendix A.4.c do not apply.</li>
                    <li>An illegal move is completed once the opponent&aposs clock has been started. The opponent is entitled to claim a win before he has made his own move. However, if the opponent cannot checkmate the player&apos;s king by any possible series of legal moves, then the claimant is entitled to claim a draw before he has made his own move. Once the opponent has made his own move, an illegal move cannot be corrected unless mutually agreed without intervention of an arbiter.</li>

       <h1>APPENDICES</h1> 
        <h2>Appendix A: Rapidplay</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A &apos;Rapidplay&apos; game is one where either all the moves must be made in a fixed time of at least 15 minutes but less than 60 minutes for each player; or the time allotted + 60 times any increment is at least 15 minutes, but less than 60 minutes for each player.</li>
            <li>Players do not need to record the moves.</li>
            <li>Where there is adequate supervision of play, (for example one arbiter for at most three games) the Competition Rules shall apply.</li>
            <li>Where supervision is inadequate the Competition Rules shall apply, except where they are overridden by the following Laws of Rapidplay:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Once each player has completed three moves, no claim can be made regarding incorrect piece placement, orientation of the chessboard or clock setting.<br />In case of reverse king and queen placement castling with this king is not allowed.</li>
                    <li>The arbiter shall make a ruling according to Article 4 (The act of moving the pieces), only if requested to do so by one or both players.</li>
                    <li>An illegal move is completed once the opponent&apos;s clock has been started. The opponent is then entitled to claim that the player completed an illegal move before the claimant has made his move. Only after such a claim, shall the arbiter make a ruling. However, if both Kings are in check or the promotion of a pawn is not completed, the arbiter shall intervene, if possible.</li>
                    <li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The flag is considered to have fallen when a player has made a valid claim to that effect. The arbiter shall refrain from signalling a flag fall, but he may do so if both flags have fallen.</li>
                            <li>To claim a win on time, the claimant must stop both clocks and notify the arbiter. For the claim to be successful, the claimant’s flag must remain up and his opponent’s flag down after the clocks have been stopped.</li>
                            <li>If both flags have fallen as described in (1) and (2), the arbiter shall declare the game drawn.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

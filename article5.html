                        The game is won by the player who has checkmated his opponent&apos;s king. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate position was a legal move.

                    <li>
                        The game is won by the player whose opponent declares he resigns. This immediately ends the game.

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his king is not in 
                        check. The game is said to end in &apos;stalemate&apos;. This immediately ends the game, 
                        provided that the move producing the stalemate position was legal.</li>Ã¹
                    <li>The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can 
                        checkmate the opponent&apos;s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to 
                        end in a &apos;dead position&apos;. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move 
                        producing the position was legal. (See Article 9.6)</li>
                    <li>The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game. This immediately ends the game. (See Article 9.1)</li>
                    <li>The game may be drawn if any identical position is about to appear or has appeared on the chessboard at least three times. (See Article 9.2)</li>
                    <li>The game may be drawn if each player has made at least the last 50 consecutive moves without the movement of any pawn and without any capture. (See Article 9.3)</li>

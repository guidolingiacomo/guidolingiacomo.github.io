        <h2>Article 10: Quickplay Finish</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A &apos;quickplay finish&apos; is the phase of a game when all the (remaining) moves must be made 
                in a limited time.</li>
            <li>If the player, having the move, has less than two minutes left on his clock, he may claim a draw before his flag falls. He shall summon the arbiter and may stop the clocks. (See Article 6.12.b)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>If the arbiter agrees the opponent is making no effort to win the game by normal means, or that it is not possible to win by normal means, then he shall declare the game drawn. Otherwise he shall postpone his decision or reject the claim.</li>
                    <li>If the arbiter postpones his decision, the opponent may be awarded two extra minutes and the game shall continue, if possible in the presence of an arbiter. The arbiter shall declare the final result later in the game or as soon as possible after a flag has fallen. He shall declare the game drawn if he agrees that the final position cannot be won by normal means, or that the opponent was not making sufficient attempts to win by normal means.</li>
                    <li>If the arbiter has rejected the claim, the opponent shall be awarded two extra minutes time</li>
                    <li>The decision of the arbiter shall be final relating to (a), (b) and (c).</li>
                </ol>

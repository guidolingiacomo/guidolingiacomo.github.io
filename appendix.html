                    <ol>
                        <li>A &apos;Rapidplay&apos; game is one where either all the moves must be made in a fixed time of at least 15 minutes but less than 60 minutes for each player; or the time allotted + 60 times any increment is at least 15 minutes, but less than 60 minutes for each player.</li>
                        <li id="A-2">Players do not need to record the moves.</li>
                        <li>Where there is adequate supervision of play, (for example one arbiter for at most three games) the Competition Rules shall apply.</li>
                        <li id="A-4">Where supervision is inadequate the Competition Rules shall apply, except where they are overridden by the following Laws of Rapidplay:

                                <li>Once each player has completed three moves, no claim can be made regarding incorrect piece placement, orientation of the chessboard or clock setting.<br />In case of reverse king and queen placement castling with this king is not allowed.</li>
                                <li>The arbiter shall make a ruling according to <a href="/article.html#4">Article 4 (The act of moving the pieces)</a>, only if requested to do so by one or both players.</li>
                                <li>An illegal move is completed once the opponent&apos;s clock has been started. The opponent is then entitled to claim that the player completed an illegal move before the claimant has made his move. Only after such a claim, shall the arbiter make a ruling. However, if both Kings are in check or the promotion of a pawn is not completed, the arbiter shall intervene, if possible.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The flag is considered to have fallen when a player has made a valid claim to that effect. The arbiter shall refrain from signalling a flag fall, but he may do so if both flags have fallen.</li>
                                        <li>To claim a win on time, the claimant must stop both clocks and notify the arbiter. For the claim to be successful, the claimant&apos;s flag must remain up and his opponent&apos;s flag down after the clocks have been stopped.</li>
                                        <li>If both flags have fallen as described in (1) and (2), the arbiter shall declare the game drawn.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>A &apos;blitz&apos; game is one where all the moves must be made in a fixed time of less than 15 minutes for each player; or the allotted time + 60 times any increment is less than 15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Where there is adequate supervision of play, (one arbiter for one game) the Competition Rules and <a href="#A-2">Appendix A.2</a> shall apply.</li>
                        <li>Where supervision is inadequate the following shall apply:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Play shall be governed by the Rapidplay Laws as in <a href="#A">Appendix A</a> except where they are overridden by the following Laws of Blitz.</li>
                                <li><a href="/article.html#10-2">Article 10.2</a> and <a href="#A-4">Appendix A.4.c</a> do not apply.</li>
                                <li>An illegal move is completed once the opponent&apos; clock has been started. The opponent is entitled to claim a win before he has made his own move. However, if the opponent cannot checkmate the player&apos;s king by any possible series of legal moves, then the claimant is entitled to claim a draw before he has made his own move. Once the opponent has made his own move, an illegal move cannot be corrected unless mutually agreed without intervention of an arbiter.</li>

                    <h2 id="C">Appendix C: Algebraic notation</h2>
                    <p>FIDE recognizes for its own tournaments and matches only one system of notation, the Algebraic System, and recommends the use of this uniform chess notation also for chess literature and periodicals. Scoresheets using a notation system other than algebraic may not be used as evidence in cases where normally the scoresheet of a player is used for that purpose. An arbiter who observes that a player is using a notation system other than the algebraic should warn the player about of this requirement.</p>
                    <h3>Description of the Algebraic System</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In this description, &apos;piece&apos; means a piece other than a pawn.</li>
                        <li>Each piece is indicated by the first letter, a capital letter, of its name. Example: K=king, Q=queen, R=rook, B=bishop, N=knight. (In the case of the knight, for the sake of convenience, N is used.)</li>
                        <li>For the first letter of the name of the pieces, each player is free to use the first letter of the name which is commonly used in his country. Examples: F=fou (French for bishop), L=loper (Dutch for bishop). In printed periodicals, the use of figurines for the pieces is recommended.</li>
                        <li>Pawns are not indicated by their first letter, but are recognized by the absence of such a letter. Examples: e5, d4, a5.</li>
                        <li>The eight files (from the left to right for White and from right to left for Black) are indicated by the small letters, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, respectively.</li>
                        <li>The eight ranks (from bottom to top for White and from top to bottom for Black) are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, respectively. Consequently, in the initial position the white pieces and pawns are placed on the first and second ranks; the black pieces and pawns on the eighth and seventh ranks.</li>
                        <li>As a consequence of the previous rules, each of the sixty-four squares is invariably indicated by a unique combination of a letter and a number.<br /><div class="polaroid"><img class="image" src="/algebricSystem.png" alt="COMBINATION OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS"/><div style="padding: 10px 20px;"><br /></div></div></li>
                        <li>Each move of a piece is indicated by a) the first letter of the name of the piece in question and b) the square of arrival. There is no hyphen between a) and b). Examples: Be5, Nf3, Rd1.<br />In the case of pawns, only the square of arrival is indicated. Examples: e5, d4, a5.</li>
                        <li>When a piece makes a capture, an x is inserted between a) the first letter of the name of the piece in question and b) the square of arrival. Examples: Bxe5, Nxf3, Rxd1.<br />When a pawn makes a capture, the file of departure must be indicated, then an x, then the square of arrival. Examples: dxe5, gxf3, axb5. In the case of an &apos;en passante&apos; capture, the square of arrival is given as the square on which the capturing pawn finally rests and &apos;e.p.&apos; is appended to the notation. Example: exd6 e.p.</li>
                        <li>If two identical pieces can move to the same square, the piece that is moved is indicated as follows:
                            <ol>
                                <li>If both pieces are on the same rank: by a) the first letter of the name of the piece, b) the file of departure, and c) the square of arrival.</li>
                                <li>If both pieces are on the same file: by a) the first letter of the name of the piece, b) the rank of the square of departure, and c) the square of arrival.</li>
                            </ol>
                            If the pieces are on different ranks and files method 1) is preferred.<br />In the case of capture, an x may be inserted between b) and c).<br />Examples:
                            <ol>
                                <li>There are two knights, on the squares g1 and e1, and one of them moves to the square f3: either Ngf3 or Nef3, as the case may be.</li>
                                <li>There are two knights, on the squares g5 and g1, and one of them moves to the square f3: either N5f3 or N1f3, as the case may be.</li>
                                <li>There are two knights, on the squares h2 and d4, and one of them moves to the square f3: either Nhf3 or Ndf3, as the case may be.</li>
                            </ol>
                            If a capture takes place on the square f3, the previous examples are changed by the insertion of an x: 1) either Ngxf3 or Nexf3, 2) either N5xf3 or N1xf3, 3) either Nhxf3 or Ndxf3, as the case may be.
                        </li>
                        <li>If two pawns can capture the same piece or pawn of the opponent, the pawn that is moved is indicated by a) the letter of the file of departure, b) an x, c) the square of arrival. Example: If there are white pawns on squares c4 and e4 and a black pawn or piece on the square d5, the notation for White&apos;s move is either cxd5 or exd5, as the case may be.</li>
                        <li>In the case of the promotion of a pawn, the actual pawn move is indicated, followed immediately by the first letter of the new piece. Examples: d8Q, f8N, b1B, g1R.</li>
                        <li id="C-13">The offer of a draw shall be marked as (=).</li>

                        <li>Where games are played as in <a href="/article.html#10">Article 10</a>, a player may claim a draw when he has less than two minutes left on his clock and before his flag falls. This concludes the game.<br />He may claim on the basis:</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Tournament directors shall have the power to adapt the following rules according to local circumstances. In competitive chess between sighted and visually handicapped players (legally blind) either player may demand the use of two boards, the sighted player using a normal board, the visually handicapped player using one specially constructed. The specially constructed board must meet the following requirements:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>at least 20 by 20 centimetres, and</li>
                                <li>the black squares slightly raised, and</li>
                                <li>a securing aperture in each square, and</li>
                                <li>every piece provided with a peg that fits into the securing aperture, and</li>
                                <li>pieces of Staunton design, the black pieces being specially marked.</li>

                                <li>The moves shall be announced clearly, repeated by the opponent and executed on his chessboard. When promoting a pawn, the player must announce which piece is chosen. To make the announcement as clear as possible, the use of the following names is suggested instead of the corresponding letters, algebraic.<br />A - Anna<br />B - Bella<br />C - Cesar<br />D - David<br />E - Eva<br />F - Felix<br />G - Gustav<br />H - Hector<br /><br />Ranks from white to black shall receive the German numbers:<br />1 - eins<br />2 - zwei<br />3 - drei<br />4 - vier<br />5 - fuenf<br />6 - sechs<br />7 - sieben<br />8 - acht<br /><br />Castling is announced “Lange Rochade” (German for long castling) and “Kurze<br />Rochade” (German for short castling).<br />The pieces bear the names: Koenig, Dame, Turm, Laeufer, Springer, Bauer. </li>
                                <li>On the visually handicapped player&apos;s board a piece shall be considered &apos;touched&apos; when it has been taken out of the securing aperture.</li>
                                <li>A move shall be considered &apos;executed&apos; when:

                                        <li>in the case of a capture, the captured piece has been removed from the board of the player whose turn it is to move</li>
                                        <li>a piece is placed into a different securing aperture</li>

                                    Only then the opponent&apos;s clock shall be started.<br />As far as points 2 and 3 are concerned the normal rules are valid for the sighted player.
                                </li>
                                <li>A specially constructed chess clock for the visually handicapped shall be admissible. It shall incorporate the following features:

                                        <li>a dial fitted with reinforced hands, with every five minutes marked by one dot, and every 15 minutes by two raised dots, and</li>
                                        <li>a flag which can be easily felt. Care should be taken that the flag is so arranged as to allow the player to feel the minute hand during the last 5 minutes of the full hour.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>The visually handicapped player must keep score of the game in Braille or longhand or record the moves on a tape recorder.</li>
                                <li>A slip of the tongue in the announcement of a move must be corrected immediately and before the clock of the opponent is started.</li>
                                <li>If during a game different positions should arise on the two boards, they must be corrected with the assistance of the controller and by consulting both players&apos; game scores.

                    <h2 id="F">Appendix F: Chess960 Rules</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Before a Chess960 game a starting position is randomly set up, subject to certain rules. After this, the game is played in the same way as standard chess. In particular, pieces and pawns have their normal moves, and each player's objective is to checkmate the opponent&apos;s king.</li>
                        <li><bold>Starting position requirements</bold><br />The starting position for Chess960 must meet certain rules. White pawns are placed on the second rank as in regular chess. All remaining white pieces are placed randomly on the first rank, but with the following restrictions:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and</li>
                                <li>the bishops are placed on opposite-colored squares, and</li>
                                <li>the black pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to the white pieces.</li>
                            </ol>
                            The starting position can be generated before the game either by a computer program or using dice, coin, cards, etc.                
                        </li>
                        <li><bold>Chess960 Castling Rules</bold>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Chess960 allows each player to castle once per game, a move by potentially both the king and rook in a single move. However, a few interpretations of standard chess games rules are needed for castling, because the standard rules presume initial locations of the rook and king that are often not applicable in Chess960.</li>
                                <li><i>How to castle</i><br />In Chess960, depending on the pre-castling position on the castling king and rook, the castling manoeuvre is performed by one of these four methods:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>double-move castling: by on one turn making a move with the king and a move with the rook, or</li>
                                        <li>transposition castling: by transposing the position of the king and the rook, or</li>
                                        <li>king-move-only castling: by making only a move with the king, or</li>
                                        <li>rook-move-only castling: by making only a move with the rook.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <i>Recommendation</i>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>When castling on a physical board with a human player, it is recommended that the king be moved outside the playing surface next to his final position, the rook then be moved from its starting to ending position, and then the king be placed on his final square.</li>
                                        <li>After castling, the rook and king&apos;s final positions are exactly the same positions as they would be in standard chess.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <i>Clarification</i><br />Thus, after c-side castling (notated as O-O-O and known as queen-side castling in orthodox chess), the King is on the c-square (c1 for White and c8 for Black) and the Rook is on the d-square (d1 for White and d8 for Black). After g-side castling (notated as O-O and known as king-side castling in orthodox chess), the King is on the g-square (g1 for White and g8 for Black) and the Rook is on the f-square (f1 for White and f8 for Black).<br /><i>Notes</i>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>To avoid any misunderstanding, it may be useful to state &quot;I am about to castle&quot; before castling.</li>
                                        <li>In some starting positions, the king or rook (but not both) do not move during castling.</li>
                                        <li>In some starting positions, castling can take place as early as the first move.</li>
                                        <li>ll the squares between the king&apos;s initial and final squares (including the final square), and all of the squares between the rook's initial and final squares (including the final square), must be vacant except for the king and castling rook.</li>
                                        <li>In some starting positions, some squares can stay filled during castling that would have to be vacant in standard chess. For example, after c-side castling (O-O-O), it&apos;s possible for to have a, b, and/or e still filled, and after g-side castling (O-O), it&apos;s possible to have e and/or h filled.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

            <h1>BASIC RULES OF PLAY</h1>
            <h2>Article 3: The moves of the pieces</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. If 
                    a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent&apos;s piece the latter is captured and 
                    removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an 
                    opponent&apos;s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square according to the 
                    Articles 3.2 to 3.8.
                    A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving 
                    to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under 
                    attack.</li>
                <li>The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it stands.<br /><img class="image" src="/Bishop.png" alt="BISHOP"/></li>
                <li>The rook may move to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands.<br /><img class="image" src="/Rook.png" alt="ROOK"/></li>
                <li>The queen may move to any square along the file, the rank or a diagonal on which it stands.<br /><img class="image" src="/Queen.png" alt="QUEEN"/></li>
                <li>When making these moves the bishop, rook or queen may not move over any intervening pieces.</li>
                <li>The knight may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal.<br /><img class="image" src="/Knight.png" alt="KNIGHT"/></li>
                <li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on 
                            the same file, or</li>
                        <li>on its first move the pawn may move as in 3.7.a or alternatively it may advance two 
                            squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied, or</li>
                        <li>the pawn may move to a square occupied by an opponent&apos;s piece, which is 
                            diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece.<br /><img class="image" src="/Pawn.png" alt="PAWN"/></li>
                        <li>A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent&apos;s pawn which has advanced two 
                            squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent&apos;s pawn as 
                            though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the 
                            move following this advance and is called an &apos;en passant&apos; capture.<br /><img class="image" src="/enPassant.png" alt="EN PASSANT"/></li>
                        <li>When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position it must be 
                            exchanged as part of the same move on the same square for a new queen, rook, 
                            bishop or knight of the same colour. The player&apos;s choice is not restricted to pieces 
                            that have been captured previously. This exchange of a pawn for another piece is 
                            called &apos;promotion&apos; and the effect of the new piece is immediate.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                <li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>There are two different ways of moving the king:<br />
                            by moving to any adjoining square not attacked by one or more of the opponent&apos;s 
                            pieces <br /> or by &apos;castling&apos;.<br /><img class="image" src="/King.png" alt="KING"/><br />This is a move of the king and either rook of the same colour along 
                            the player&apos;s first rank, counting as a single move of the king and executed as 
                            follows: the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards the 
                            rook on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has 
                            just crossed.

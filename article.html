                    <h2 id="1">Article 1: The nature and objectives of the game of chess</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately on a square board called a &apos;chessboard&apos;. The player with the white pieces commences the game. A player is said to &apos;have the move&apos;, when his opponent&apos;s move has been &apos;made&apos;. (See <a href="#6-7">Article 6.7</a>)</li>
                        <li>The objective of each player is to place the opponent&apos;s king &apos;under attack&apos; in such a way that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have &apos;checkmated&apos; the opponent&apos;s king and to have won the game. Leaving one&apos;s own king under attack, exposing one&apos;s own king to attack and also &apos;capturing&apos; the opponent&apos;s king are not allowed. The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.</li>
                        <li>If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2 id="2">Article 2: The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li id="2-1">The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the &apos;white&apos; squares) and dark (the &apos;black&apos; squares). The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the near corner square to the right of the player is white.</li>
                        <li>At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces (the &apos;white&apos; pieces); the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the &apos;black&apos; pieces).<br />

                    <ol>
                        <li>It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. If 
                            a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent&apos;s piece the latter is captured and 
                            removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an 
                            opponent&apos;s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square according to the 
                            <a href="#3-2">Articles 3.2</a> to <a href="#3-8">3.8</a>.
                            A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving 
                            to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under 
                            attack.</li>

                        <li>The knight may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal.<br /><div class="polaroid"><img class="image" src="/Knight.png" alt="KNIGHT"/><div class="bottomPolaroid"><br /></div></div></li>

                                    the same file, or</li>
                                <li>on its first move the pawn may move as in <a href="#3-7">3.7.a</a> or alternatively it may advance two 
                                    squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied, or</li>
                                <li>the pawn may move to a square occupied by an opponent&apos;s piece, which is 
                                    diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece.<br /><div class="polaroid"><img class="image" src="/Pawn.png" alt="PAWN"/><div class="bottomPolaroid"><br /></div></div></li>
                                <li>A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent&apos;s pawn which has advanced two 
                                    squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent&apos;s pawn as 
                                    though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the 
                                    move following this advance and is called an &apos;en passant&apos; capture.<br /><div class="polaroid"><img class="image" src="/enPassant.png" alt="EN PASSANT"/><div class="bottomPolaroid"><br /></div></div></li>
                                <li>When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position it must be 
                                    exchanged as part of the same move on the same square for a new queen, rook, 
                                    bishop or knight of the same colour. The player&apos;s choice is not restricted to pieces 
                                    that have been captured previously. This exchange of a pawn for another piece is 
                                    called &apos;promotion&apos; and the effect of the new piece is immediate.</li>

                                    follows: the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards the 
                                    rook on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has

If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. The clocks shall be adjusted according to <a href="#6-13">Article 6.13</a>. The <a href="#4-3">Articles 4.3</a> and <a href="#4-6">4.6</a> apply to the move replacing the illegal move.

                    <ol>
                        <li>In the course of play each player is required to record his own moves and those of his opponent in the correct manner, move after move, as clearly and legibily as possible, in the algebraic notation (See <a href="/appendix.html#C">Appendix C</a>), on the scoresheet prescribed for the competition.<br />It is forbidden to write the moves in advance, unless the player is claiming a draw according to <a href="#9-2">Article 9.2</a>, or <a href="#9-3">9.3</a> or adjourning a game according to the <a href="/adjourned.html">Guidelines of Adjourned Games</a> point 1.a.<br />A player may reply to his opponent&apos;s move before recording it, if he so wishes. He must record his previous move before making another.<br />Both players must record the offer of a draw on the scoresheet. (See <a href="/appendix.html#C">Appendix C.13</a>)<br />If a player is unable to keep score, an assistant, who must be acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to write the moves. His clock shall be adjusted by the arbiter in an equitable way.</li>
                        <li>The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter throughout the game.</li>
                        <li>The scoresheets are the property of the organisers of the event.</li>
                        <li>If a player has less than five minutes left on his clock at some stage in a period and does not have additional time of 30 seconds or more added with each move, then for the remainder of the period he is not obliged to meet the requirements of Article 8.1. Immediately after one flag has fallen the player must update his scoresheet completely before moving a piece on the chessboard.</li>
                        <li>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>If neither player is required to keep score under Article 8.4, the arbiter or an assistant should try to be present and keep score. In this case, immediately after one flag has fallen, the arbiter shall stop the clocks. Then both players shall update their scoresheets, using the arbiter&apos;s or the opponent&apos;s scoresheet.</li>
                                <li>If only one player is not required to keep score under Article 8.4, he must, as soon as either flag has fallen, update his scoresheet completely before moving a piece on the chessboard. Provided it is the player&apos;s move, he may use his opponent&apos;s scoresheet, but must return it before making a move.</li>
                                <li>If no complete scoresheet is available, the players must reconstruct the game on a second chessboard under the control of the arbiter or an assistant. He shall first record the actual game position, clock times and the number of moves made, if this information is available, before reconstruction takes place.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>If the scoresheets cannot be brought up to date showing that a player has overstepped the allotted time, the next move made shall be considered as the first of the following time period, unless there is evidence that more moves have been made.</li>
                        <li>At the conclusion of the game both players shall sign both scoresheets, indicating the result of the game. Even if incorrect, this result shall stand, unless the arbiter decides otherwise.</li>

                                <li>The rules of a competition may specify that players cannot agree to a draw, whether in less than a specified number of moves or at all, without the consent of the arbiter.</li>
                                <li>If the rules of a competition allow a draw agreement the following apply:

                                        <li>A player wishing to offer a draw shall do so after having made a move on the chessboard and before stopping his clock and starting the opponent&apos;s clock. An offer at any other time during play is still valid but <a href="#12-6">Article 12.6</a> must be considered. No conditions can be attached to the offer. In both cases the offer cannot be withdrawn and remains valid until the opponent accepts it, rejects it orally, rejects it by touching a piece with the intention of moving or capturing it, or the game is concluded in some other way.</li>
                                        <li>The offer of a draw shall be noted by each player on his scoresheet with a symbol. (See <a href="/appendix.html#C-13">Appendix C.13</a>)</li>

                            Positions as in (a) and (b) are considered the same, if the same player has the move, pieces of the same kind and colour occupy the same squares, and the possible moves of all the pieces of both players are the same.<br />Positions are not the same if a pawn that could have been captured en passant can no longer be captured in this manner. When a king or a rook is forced to move, it will lose its castling rights, if any, only after it is moved.

                                <li>he writes his move on his scoresheet and declares to the arbiter his intention to make this move, which shall result in the last 50 moves having been made by each player without the movement of any pawn and without any capture, or</li>
                                <li>the last 50 consecutive moves have been made by each player without the movement of any pawn and without any capture.</li>

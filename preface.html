        <h1>PREFACE</h1> 
        <p>The Laws of Chess cannot cover all possible situations that may arise during a game, nor can they regulate all administrative questions. Where cases are not precisely regulated by an Article of the Laws, it should be possible to reach a correct decision by studying analogous situations which are discussed in the Laws. The Laws assume that arbiters have the necessary competence, sound judgement and absolute objectivity. Too detailed a rule might deprive the arbiter of his freedom of judgement and thus prevent him from finding the solution to a problem dictated by fairness, logic and special factors.<br />FIDE appeals to all chess players and federations to accept this view.</p>
        <p>A member federation is free to introduce more detailed rules provided they:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>do not conflict in any way with the official FIDE Laws of Chess, and</li>
            <li>are limited to the territory of the federation concerned, and</li>
            <li>are not valid for any FIDE match, championship or qualifying event, or for a FIDE title or rating tournament.</li>
        </ol>

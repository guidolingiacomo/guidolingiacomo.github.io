       <h1>BASIC RULES OF PLAY</h1> 
        <h2>Article 1: The nature and objectives of the game of chess</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately on a square board called a &apos;chessboard&apos;. The player with the white pieces commences the game. A player is said to &apos;have the move&apos;, when his opponent&apos;s move has been &apos;made&apos;. (See Article 6.7)</li>
            <li>The objective of each player is to place the opponent&apos;s king &apos;under attack&apos; in such a way that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have &apos;checkmated&apos; the opponent&apos;s king and to have won the game. Leaving one&apos;s own king under attack, exposing one&apos;s own king to attack and also &apos;capturing&apos; the opponent&apos;s king are not allowed. The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.</li>
            <li>If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.</li>
        </ol>

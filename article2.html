The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the near corner square to the right of the player is white.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces (the &apos;white&apos; pieces); the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the &apos;black&apos; pieces).</li>
            <li>The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard is as follows:</li>
            <li>The eight vertical columns of squares are called &apos;files&apos;. The eight horizontal rows of squares are called &apos;ranks&apos;. A straight line of squares of the same colour, running from one edge of the board to an adjacent edge, is called a &apos;diagonal&apos;.</li>
